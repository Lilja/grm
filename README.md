grm
====

### What is it?
grm is an experimental package manager for GitHub Releases. It is probably good in installing only packages which are distributed as binaries (for example the ones written in Go)


### How to use it?
> For full reference type `grm`

`grm` installs packages in `~/.grm/bin` directory. Add it to PATH for convenience
